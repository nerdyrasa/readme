# [mu]dacity: The Unofficial Udacity Micro-community

### About

This organization is for Udacity students, alumnae, and staff to collaborate on community projects.

### Groups

New members are automatically invited to the `members` group. This group has **read** access to repositories. You can contribute to projects by opening issues, forking repositories, or submitting pull requests.

Upon request, or after **3 accepted pull requests**, the user can enter the `devs` group and have direct **read/write** access to repositories.

The **admins** group is for elevated organization permissions. If you're interested in helping out, please contact the admin group!

### GitHub Page

You can start contributing immediately to the GitHub page repository: [mudacity.github.io](https://github.com/mudacity/mudacity.github.io)

### Our First Project

Stay tuned on the [forum thread](http://discussions.udacity.com/t/with-our-powers-combined-udacitys-first-mega-meta-nanodegree-project/11255). Once we get consensus on the name, we'll open up **two** repositories (one for the web app/back-end and one for the iOS app).
